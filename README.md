This repository contains the code to create two specific tidy datasets from the UCI Human Activity Recognition using smartphones dataset available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).[1]

The repo contains an R script named run_analysis.R that downloads this dataset and prepares the aforementioned tidy datasets. Note that the script requires dplyr and readr packages to be installed.

The transformations the dataset had to go through in order to create the two tidy datasets, as well as the complete description of all the variables are outlined in CODEBOOK.md
